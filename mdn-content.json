However the bulk of the description is verbatim from the original set, as it doesn't change when used with ElementInternals. So, most of this has already been reviewed essentially other than the front matter, syntax and example section.</p>\n<p>This has been quite a complex one to work through and test code, but hopefully isn't too wide of the mark. I need to go make a PR to adds specs, and a couple of missing things to BCD.
