In most cases the unsigned list was not a true list of items, but a way to split in paragraph. In these cases, I transformed it in paragraphs, rephrasing a bit to make it smooth.</li>\n<li>In one case (<code>X-Content-Type-Disposition</code>), there was a whole <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> that was bogus, taken from the next paragraph in the spec, mistakenly believed to apply there.</li>\n<li>There were some <code>&lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;</code> indicating missing documentation, I added a <code>TBD</code> in them, allowing them to be converted, and making them easy to find to document them in a future phase.</li>\n</ul>",
