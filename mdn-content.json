I converted it using a version of h2m which has <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"964214584\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/mdn/yari/issues/4444\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/mdn/yari/pull/4444/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/mdn/yari/pull/4444\">mdn/yari#4444</a>, which means it understands SVG syntax highlighting.</p>\n<p>The main thing here as usual is tables. I count 57 unconverted tables out of (I think) 175 tables in the CSS docs. This is actually a much better ratio than the JS docs, in which I think around half were unconvertible. See for example <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units</a> for some simple tables that got converted.</p>\n<p>Apart from these, unconverted elements were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> elements, which we had agreed to keep as HTML</li>\n<li><code>id</code> attributes for the four tools pages. These pages use <code>EmbedLiveSample</code> in a very unconventional way, to implement essentially complete web apps. Since these don't have headings, we can't use heading IDs for the live sample. And since they are not really \"content\" it doesn't seem very important to convert them. The pages concerned are:\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Background_and_Borders/Border-image_generator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Background_and_Borders/Border-image_generator</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Background_and_Borders/Box-shadow_generator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Background_and_Borders/Box-shadow_generator</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Background_and_Borders/Border-radius_generator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Background_and_Borders/Border-radius_generator</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>a <code>dir=\"rtl\"</code> attribute which seemed like it would be worth keeping, in the example at <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing#internationalization_concerns\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing#internationalization_concerns</a>. But maybe this should be made into a live sample? Anyway, it's a tiny thing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Testing</h2>\n<p>I've not looked at every page but I have looked at quite a lot of them. I have found a few issues.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>sometimes, <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> elements are getting mangled in conversion. I filed a bug about this: <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"964225802\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/mdn/yari/issues/4445\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/mdn/yari/issues/4445/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/mdn/yari/issues/4445\">mdn/yari#4445</a>. It would be good to have this fixed, but the in-content fix is very simple and I think there are very few pages affected. So I would be OK to work around these in content for now. Affected pages (that I have found) are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape#shape_functions\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape#shape_functions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url()#values\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url()#values</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@counter-style#descriptors\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@counter-style#descriptors</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the tools pages listed above are broken, I think because the encoding of characters like <code>&lt;</code> in the live sample is confusing the converter. Ideally these pages would be part of the core Yari platform and not content pages at all. A less good option that's still better than what we have now would be to make them GitHub pages and include them using <code>EmbedGHLiveSample</code>. In the meantime I would be happy to keep these as HTML - they're not exactly editable anyway, so we don't really lose anything that way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the code elements in <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position#regarding_percentages\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position#regarding_percentages</a> are not being wrapped, and that's breaking the page layout. I haven't tried to figure out what's happening there yet.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
