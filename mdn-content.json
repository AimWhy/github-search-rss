It essentially represents raw<br>\naccelerometer data, whose values can be surprising: when a device is at rest<br>\nwith the screen pointing up, it reports +9.8 in the Z axis rather than 0;<br>\nwhen the device is in free fall, it reports 0 in the Z axis.</p>\n<p>Try to explain this in a succint way while also pointing to more detailed<br>\ninformation in related Wikipedia articles. The changes also change a<br>\nsentence that said the attribute represented a sum of acceleration on the<br>\ndevice and acceleration caused by gravity. This is confusing because the<br>\nDeviceOrientation Event spec defines <code>accelerationIncludingGravity</code> as<br>\nacceleration on the device plus an acceleration equal and <em>opposite</em> to<br>\ngravity.</p>\n<p>While here, be clear that the <code>accelerometer</code> attribute does not include the<br>\neffects of gravity, and reference the corresponding Generic Sensor API<br>\ninterfaces that provide the same data in an arguably better way and with<br>\nbetter names: <code>Accelerometer</code> and <code>LinearAccelerationSensor</code>.</p>",
